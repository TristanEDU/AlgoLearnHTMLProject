							Hi, I'm Tristan Thomas, a web developer based in North Idaho. I discovered my passion for web development
							several years ago when I built my first website and realized I could turn creative ideas into functional
							digital experiences. Since then, I've been on a journey of continuous learning, building projects that
							challenge me and help me grow as a developer.

							Background & Journey
						</h2>
						<p class="bio-section-card-row-text-p" id="bio-section-card-row-text-p2">
							My path to web development started with curiosity and a desire to understand how the internet works. I
							began with HTML and CSS, creating simple static pages, and gradually expanded my skills to include
							JavaScript, responsive design, and modern frameworks. Along the way, I've completed numerous online
							courses, built personal projects, and collaborated with others to bring ideas to life. Each project has
							taught me something new and reinforced my love for problem-solving through code.

							Approach & Philosophy
						</h2>
						<p class="bio-section-card-row-text-p" id="bio-section-card-row-text-p3">
							I believe great websites are built on a foundation of clean, semantic code and user-centered design. I
							approach every project with attention to detail, a focus on accessibility, and a commitment to writing
							code that's not just functional, but maintainable and scalable. I'm passionate about creating experiences
							that are both beautiful and intuitive, where form and function work together seamlessly.

						<p class="bio-section-card-row-text-p" id="bio-section-card-row-text-p4">
							Currently, I'm focused on expanding my JavaScript skills and diving deeper into React and modern web
							development practices. I'm particularly interested in building interactive web applications that solve
							real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to
							open-source projects, or sharing what I've learned with the developer community.
